### GreenVault ESG Policy Handbook - Internal Use Only

**Section 4.2: Thermal Coal Exposure Thresholds**
Any new investment that increases the portfolio's thermal coal revenue exposure above a 5% threshold must be immediately flagged. The Senior Analyst must then notify the Compliance Committee via a Level-2 Incident Report within 24 hours of the exposure being identified. Failure to report promptly results in mandatory retraining.

**Section 5.1: Board Diversity**
All publicly traded companies in our investment pool must maintain a board diversity score of 0.7 or higher, calculated based on the ratio of underrepresented genders and ethnic groups to total board seats. This is a non-negotiable requirement for inclusion in our funds.

**Section 6.3: Executive Compensation**
Executive bonus structures should be tied directly to measurable, long-term sustainability metrics (e.g., carbon reduction goals), not just short-term profit targets. Short-term profit bonuses should not exceed 10% of total annual compensation.

**Section 7.1: Carbon Intensity Reporting**
A carbon intensity ratio exceeding 0.5 tonnes of CO2e per $1,000 revenue is automatically considered a high-risk factor. Investments with a ratio below 0.3 are considered low-risk.

**Section 8.5: Investment Veto Power**
The Chief Compliance Officer holds the final veto power over any investment proposal that is flagged under two or more distinct policy sections (e.g., high coal exposure AND low board diversity).
